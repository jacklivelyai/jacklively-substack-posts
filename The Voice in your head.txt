The Voice in your head

### Intimate Voices

Nowadays, many people walk around with a voice in their head.

I’m one of them these people.

We move around the city, our ears stuffed with noise cancelling earbuds that not only block out external sounds, but pipe in alternative external sounds from much further away.

If you can call the internet further away. 

By a voice in their head, I’m referring to podcasts or audiobooks. 

The voice in your head seems intimate. As if it’s speaking directly to you. 

How many people are walking around with a voice in their head?

The USA leads the world with around 40% of internet users listening to podcasts.

That’s around 120 million people…

But the rest of the richest portion of the world isn’t so far behind. 

Sweden is second, but in Europe more generally around a quarter of all internet users listen to podcasts.

Globally, it’s estimated that around 20% of all internet users are listening to podcasts regularly.

Which is something like a billion people.

So yeah, A whole lot of folks are walking around with a voice in their head.

### Urban v Rural

People in Urban areas are twice as likely to be listening to podcasts than those living in rural areas, who tend to favor radio. 

This doesn’t surprise me.

I’m guessing that people living in rural and suburban areas are listening in their cars, while the city dwellers are the ones with the voice precisely in their head. 

Like me.

Listening to something in your car is not the same as walking around with a voice in your head.

Although the car does operate as a portable domestic space. 

But I’ll get back to portable domestic bubbles later.

Thinking of urban living.

When I was a little kid, my Dad took me to the big city.

The city was a place that he didn’t really like spending time in. 

He’d go in for work and then get out again, soon as he could.

We walked around the city that day. I don’t know why we were officially there, but the memory is of our observations. 

At some point, we were people watching. 

I was probably five or six.

People in the city were walking fast, almost desperately, like they were possessed or something.

My Dad said to me, “Look at them. People in the city are like zombies.”

That stuck with me. 

Maybe I’m also a zombie now.

So here in the big city, a hell of a lot  of people are walking around with a voice in their head.

### Technological Determinism

Anyway, there are many common-sensical explanations for the fact that more and more people are walking around with a voice in their head.

You can blame the internet and an exponentialized distribution of media. 

Basically for every individual preference there is a niche podcast or audiobook that will satisfy that particular desire. 

You can blame the smart phone. 

Everyone’s got a smart phone. Which is less a phone than a computational device designed to channel platform internet into individual brains.

Literally.

Bluetooth earbuds make it easy to put high quality audio into your head from your phone without getting all tangled up.

This is all true, no doubt. But, direct technological means aren’t in and of themselves a satisfying explanation for profound shifts in behavior.

And yeah, that’s what I think this is. A profound shift in behavior.

I come back to that simple statement. 

Many people these days are walking around with a voice in their head.

### Sonic Space

Leaving aside the question of voice for a moment, I want to focus on the sonic effect.

Sound is spatial, in the sense that it occupies and creates space. 

If you put on loud music in a room, the space is taken by that music. 

It’s something that nobody entering that room can ignore, unless they are deaf.

Spaces have their own sounds too. A large gymnasium, for example, has a different sound than a small kitchen, or a living room, or a church. 

This is one way that space is created in films. You can be looking at two people around a little coffee table against a fake wall on a back lot of an LA movie studio, but the sound design creates New York City or Paris.

A crowded place with loud sounds makes you feel small, diminished by the cacophony.

The call to prayer in Islamic cultures marks sacred space and time, and also occupies the territory, marking it as Islamic space. 

The same is true for how the church bells of a European village mark Christian space.

Curiously, in the Jewish tradition, there isn’t any direct equivalent to the sonic capture of territory by the muezzin’s call to prayer in Islam or the church bells in Christianity.

Sound **is** used in warfare, for example during a siege, as a means of taking the comfort of domestic space away from an enemy. 

Because if you don’t control the sound of your surroundings it’s hard to feel at home.

Technologies like blue tooth earbuds are a great means of insulating yourself from the sounds of the city.

Putting in a pair of noise cancelling AirPod Pro 2s as I leave the house creates a spatial bubble that surrounds and insulates me from whatever’s going on outside.

The experience of moving through the city on foot, or on a bike, is sort of weird and beautiful all at the same time. 

We can also think about this bubble of sound as a portable domestic envelope that people carry with them as they move around the city. 

Just today I stopped on a relatively busy street and counted approximately seven out of ten pedestrians and cyclists, who like me wore earbuds, gazing around with that thousand yard stare.

Distant, yet proximate. Together, but separated.

Comforted and protected by the voice in our heads.

### Urban / Strangers: Richard Sennet

Richard Sennet is an American Sociologist who wrote about the experience of people from the countryside migrating to new urban concentrations like Paris and London in the 17th to 19th centuries.

Which accompanied the shift from an agrarian to an industrial society.

One fresh new phenomenon in this massive adjustment, was that people now living in a city had a greatly increased likelihood of running into strangers.

Thinking about that for a second, we need to understand that this experience was totally new.

Back in the days of an agrarian society, anonymity would have been tough to impossible. 

In 16th century England, laws required individuals to belong to a parish or face potential punishment. Indeed, it was a responsibility of the parish to account for individuals within its boundaries.

Plus, the family was important, and villages were places where an extended family or three or four lived, with the odd new resident coming in once in a while.

Strangers arriving into town were viewed with interest, and suspicion, and certainly not left to their own devices.

So, living in a village, you wouldn’t often have a chance to meet a complete stranger.

Back to these growing cities. 

According to Richard Sennet, one result arising from the increased chance of running into strangers, was a kind of inward turn towards the domestic environment. 

People became shy because of all those strangers. Public spaces were no longer intimate in the way that say, the village green or a local church might be.

The domestic abode became the sanctuary that we recognize today. An intimate space where we can “be our authentic selves”.

Because, at the same time as the domestic space was becoming so intimate, the public spaces became sites of increasing formality. 

People “acted” out, becoming literally theatrical. Instead of being “authentic”, they began performing in the public sphere. 

Consider what you know, or have seen in films about old fashioned **manners** and the way that people dressed in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Other consequences of this likelihood of running into strangers were positive. 

Like the anonymity that you could gain, and the independence and freedom from your oppressive family. The liberation of being beholden to nobody but yourself.

Back to podcasts, and the protective bubble of domesticity that sound can create for you as you move through the city.

Richard Sennet’s ideas are interesting when you consider this **portable domestic envelope** in light of the developing urban space. 

But he was writing in the 1970s about changes that occurred in the 17th through 19th centuries. 

Things have evolved since then. The city has changed.

And also, the definition of what constitutes a stranger must have changed too.

Consider the shifts. 

First there are many more people in cities.

But at the same time, the strangeness of these people to each other has also shifted.

It’s one thing if you’re running into a stranger from a village fifty miles away. 

You know, maybe it was shocking to come across someone who you didn’t know…

It’s yet another thing to run into a stranger from a village 5,000 miles away, with a different religion, skin color, way of dressing, set of cultural references, cuisine, music, whatever.

In other words, a **foreigner**. 

Hilariously, it’s difficult to use that term these days. 

Foreigner.

That’s just the name of a band from the 1980s right?

At least in the UK and USA, it’s considered very uncool to refer to a person as a foreigner. 

And I get why. That’s fine. 

But the fact is that there are such things as people who are foreign to each other. 

In other words, slightly more strange than a regular old vanilla stranger.

London, in 1977 had a foreign born population of around 14%.

Today, in 2024, 40% of the city is foreign born. 

American cities like Chicago and Los Angeles have a similar profile, with a similar shift in demographics.

So, today’s city dwellers have not only a vastly increased likelihood of running into strangers, because of how city populations have grown, but also an increased likelihood of running into strangers who are also foreigners.

That is to say people who they don’t know, from alien cultures that they are unfamiliar with.

---

Which is stressful, obviously.

That’s my only point. 

Look at this in a narrative sense. Like a drama tv show or something. 

The domestic family story is already complicated.

When outside people come into the picture, it gets even more complicated. 

The mailman, the sister’s best friend, the brother’s girlfriend. A teacher. All of these external interventions can easily complicate family matters. 

You take the drama out of the house, to school or to work and the potential complications multiply.

Once strangers get involved you go from complicated to complex pretty fast. 

Add in cultural alienation, strangers who’s behavior you have no anthropological preparation for understanding and anticipating.

Pretty soon the potential for complexity is intense, and I guess stressful. 

---

So, nowadays, many people in cities walk around with a disembodied voice in their head.

A disembodied voice that is presumably speaking in a language that they understand. 

Creating a sonic bubble that surrounds and protects them from the exterior.

Thus we glide more comfortably through the city, bemused by all kinds of strangers, slightly less vulnerable than we might otherwise feel.

Protected by the disembodied voice in our head.

### Disembodied

Yes, a disembodied voice.

The voice in your head, piped in from the internet, is not connected to a source that you can visually associate it with. 

This is the literal meaning of disembodied.

But, a disembodied voice can also imply a separation between identity and physical form, introducing themes of alienation or the supernatural. 

A ghostly voice, for example.

A disembodied voice can evoke feelings of eeriness or power, as the speaker may seem omnipresent or beyond human limits. 

Certainly, the disembodied voice is out of reach.

In religious contexts, a disembodied voice is linked to spiritual entities, perceived as coming from beyond the physical world and evoking fear or reverence.

---

Here’s what I’ve noticed. 

When I run into someone I know, who’s got their ears stuffed with hardware, they don’t seem super happy to stop the voice in their head and say hi.

They do it, as a matter of courtesy. But, I get the feeling that they’d much rather just continue their journey, gliding through the park or the street pillowed by the voice in their head.

And I can understand that.

With a set of noise cancelling earphones it feels like someone speaking directly to you. 

The voice in your head is telling you things. Maybe important things.

### Bicameral Mind

In the 1970s an American Psychologist named Julian Jaynes published [*The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind). 

Which would be the only book he ever published.

it’s a bit of a wacky theory, but it’s also interesting, evocative, and possibly relevant.

Remember this: You don’t need to agree with a theory in order to find it interesting. It’s easy to criticize and hard to propose. Jaynes made a fascinating set of propositions.

One question he was trying to answer was: how come human beings were able to develop social groups larger than other groups of animals.

In other words, how is it that people know what to do in situations where clarity isn’t directly evident, like when moral and ethical questions arise, or certain kinds of problem solving.

Social groups of animals like wolves, apes, birds, are confined to a population of individuals small enough that any one animal can receive visual or auditory command signals from the leader, and therefore know what they’re supposed to do.

In other words, animals don’t really know what they’re supposed to do by themselves. There is no internal policeman installed in their brains.

They need to be given clear commands. 

Have you ever seen your dog standing there looking at you stupidly? 

Humans, according to Jaynes, were able to definitively detach themselves from direct command and control, only by the development of consciousness.

### Consciousness

Jaynes defined consciousness in a way that differs significantly from the common understanding of the term. 

His definition focuses on a **narrative structure of internal thought** rather than sensory awareness or perception, meaning it involves constructing a continuous story of one’s life, linking past events, present awareness, and future plans. 

The narrative function allows individuals to situate themselves within the flow of time and create a cohesive identity.

Other elements of Consciousness for Jaynes included:

The capacity for introspection. Being able to conduct an internal dialogue. Having a “mind space”.

The third important thing was the use of metaphors and analogs. 

Basically, modeling the world in your mind, and therefore being able to play out possible scenarios mentally.

But Jaynes theorized that consciousness was only developed some 3,000 years ago.

And, his theory of the bicameral mind is essentially an attempt to trace the move from unconsciousness to consciousness.

### Bicameralism

The theory of a bicameral mind proposes an intermediate evolutionary stage that is pre-consciousness, but post-animal. 

And guess what that involves….

You got it, the bicameral mind is all about disembodied voices in people’s heads.

The other thing bicameralism involves are the two hemispheres of the brain.

Before 3,000 years ago, humans didn’t have self-aware consciousness like we do now, but they were still more independent than primates, birds, wolves, or fish.

The bicameral brain functioned in two parts: one hemisphere issued commands that were experienced as auditory hallucinations, or a voice in the head. 

That voice was interpreted as the voice of a god, or of the leader. 

For Jaynes these auditory hallucinations account for idol worship. 

The voices were projected as coming from divine figures that people kept at home.

The other hemisphere of the brain obeyed automatic responses to these "voices," with no internal reflection or self-awareness. 

According to Jaynes, this bicameral mental structure broke down as societies became more complex, leading to the development of modern consciousness and self-reflective thought.

And as the bicameral mind broke down, fewer people heard such voices, which shifted authority to written laws, prophets, and later, introspective thought.

Biblical stories trace this traumatic transition. 

For example, the story of Moses, who climbs mount Sinai to receive the ten commandments. 

With their leader’s absence, the people of Israel lose the divine voice, and therefore degenerate back to worshiping idols.

Also, the need to inscribe the divine commandments onto stone, through writing, can be understood as a compensation for the loss of divine voice. 

---

According to Jaynes there are a few residual effects of the Bicameral Mind, still present in modern humans.

Auditory hallucinations during stress, mental illness, or spiritual experiences may be remnants of the bicameral mind.

The ability to enter hypnotic states, following commands without conscious thought, can be viewed as a return to the bicameral mind, where one part of the brain leads and the other follows.

Schizophrenia symptoms, like hearing voices or feeling controlled, may stem from a dysfunction linked to the bicameral mind, where people once acted on hallucinated commands.

### Conclusion

Returning to the voices in our heads today, in the 21st century.

People are once again walking around with a disembodied voice in their head.

If this phenomenon continuous to grow in the manner it has, we could soon end up with the majority of people in the richest cities on earth walking around with a disembodied voice in their head at any given time.

Since I’m one of them, I totally get how great it is.

And, understandable within the context. 

This is just a speculation, and I know it’s a bizarre thought.

I’m wondering if it’s possible that what people term “advanced societies” are transforming into societies of post-consciousness?

Particularly how it’s almost common-sensical to correlate wealth with reason, or rationality.

Who knows, maybe the introduction of internet into social organisms, combined with a massive cultural mixing, has created such conditions of mental confusion that human consciousness as it has been slowly evolving over the last few millennia, is now making a rapid mutation into something else.

Call it post-consciousness.

Think about that next time you’re out walking in the park, with those noise cancelling ear buds stuffed into your head, listening to a disembodied voice while around you others hustle past, each one with their own voice speaking intimately, only to them.

And perhaps sometimes, the person avoiding eye contact with you so that they remain undisturbed inside their portable domestic bubble of sound, with a disembodied voice speaking only for them, is actually hearing exactly the same voice as you are.
