To Escalate
### Intro

To Escalate or to De-Escalate, That is the question.

Or so it would seem, reading the news these days. 

less than a week after October 7th, 2023, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for an end to the "sickening cycle of escalation". 

Now, we’re in the late months of 2024 and the words Escalate and De-Escalate are still being flung around all the time, In relation to the Middle East and Ukraine. 

Check out this little sound byte compilation i made…

Generally speaking, Escalation has a pejorative tenor, when emerging as a word from the organs of western power.

De-Escalating can sound pretty good if you don’t think about it too hard.

Like you’re de-escalating by talking someone down from jumping off the Brooklyn bridge. 

If I de-escalate a suicidal person off the bridge I’m expecting a Nobel prize or at least free lunch.

### The Metaphor

The metaphor works for me here, de-escalating a situation where there’s someone poised at the edge, ready to jump.

Literally up at the dangerous part of the ladder.

It works for relatively simple conditions.

Suicidal persons, divorce, penalties on your parking ticket if you don’t pay on time.

Customer complaints if there’s an issue with the air conditioning on an airplane.

The cost of living can escalate.

Maybe you’d want to de-escalate tensions with your mother-in-law.

I said ***relatively*** simple

But none of these examples are in any way equivalent to an existing war between state and non state actors representing millions of people either side of the zone. 

The metaphor here is an escalator, the kind you ride up and down.

The original root goes deeper, basically to the idea of a ladder, or to climb by stages. 

You’re on the escalator and you can either get off it and de-escalate, or you can stay on it and get to the top.

Strange because it’s very hard to get off an escalator, and also.. why would you want to?

But anyway…

### Vietnam

During the Vietnam war, Americans began using the notion of “escalation” in regards to the United States’ involvement in an already existing conflict. 

First there were military advisors sent in.

Then, the Gulf of Tonkin Incident incident allowed President Johnson to secure the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which gave him broad authority to escalate U.S. military involvement without a formal declaration of war. 

Things kept on escalating until they’d managed to get over 50,000 American troops bogged down in an un-winnable war in Vietnam.

By the end of the 60s everyone knew that the Americans were never going to win.

So they began to de-escalate. 

This term “de-escalation” only entered into the lexicon really with the impending defeat of the Americans and their withdrawal from the battle zone.

Which means that in the context of the American experience in Vietnam, they escalated in confidence, and de-escalated in sudden humility when they realized it wasn’t going according to the plan. 

De-escalation then would be like calling for Plan C, or worse. 

The other thing of course, is that America was able to choose escalation, and then de-escalation. 

Because, Charlie don’t surf.

There was never any danger of a vietcong attack on the continental United States.

They would have needed quite a surfboard to travel 8,200 miles. 

Escalation and De-escalation was unilateral. Basically an arbitrary decision by the American government.

And guess who never de-escalated, the South Vietnamese. 

In fact, the gift of de-escalation ended quite poorly for those war participants who actually lived in the neighborhood.

How poorly?

- Around **2 million** South Vietnamese became refugees following the fall of Saigon in 1975. Many of these were the so called "Boat People".
- Between **200,000 and 400,000** of the boat people died at sea due to drowning, starvation, or piracy.
    - Consider that for a moment. 200,000 to 400,000 deaths of refugees on the sea back in the 70s.
    - Just as an exercise in scale, compare it to the current refugee crisis in the Mediterranean. The International Organization for Migration estimates that over **30,000 migrants** have died or gone missing while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea since the beginning of the crisis.
- After the war ended in 1975, the communist government of Vietnam sent up **to 1 million** South Vietnamese soldiers, officials, and intellectuals to harsh re-education camps. Tens of thousands of them died.

So, while it might have been necessary to eventually De-Escalate the Vietnam war, it came at a steep price.

### Misplaced Metaphor

The metaphor of escalation and de-escalation seems to work pretty well when we’re discussing US involvement in Vietnam, or some other over seas situation. 

You can literally see an imaginary escalator stretching over the Pacific ocean, from Los Angeles to Da-Nang.

But among the people living in Vietnam it’s hard to see a big old escalator in the sky. You’d need to generate an image of millions of tiny escalators, all mixed up together in a chaotic woven tapestry of actual living relations. 

People, in Vietnam, where they lived cheek by jowl, were mingled, fighting over stuff. They’ve had shared history and ancient tribal conflicts, as well as diverse experiences of colonialism under the French.

In other words, for the Vietnamese it’s not a simple question of escalation, a metaphor which seems incapable of handling the complexities of any real situation.

Indeed, the escalator metaphor asks us to imagine a kind of isolated ladder like structure that rises above the surface level, it’s a transcendent model.

In reality, the substantial problem is immanent to the body of organic life down below. 

So, what metaphor would have been more appropriate for the Vietnamese context?

You’d need something that captures the systemic nature of the issues at hand, the highly complex inter-relational system of an organic body of people.

Maybe something medical, like inflammation and de-inflammation.

### Inflaming the Situation

Let’s try and roll with this. 

Inflammation in the body is a symptom of a disorder that lies below the surface. 

Call it the underlying problem.

You sprain an ankle and the joint gets inflamed. Usually, you can ice it, raise it, and rest it for a while until the underlying cause of the inflammation sorts itself out.

Resting, icing, and raising your leg on a pillow, simply reduces the painful symptoms. This has nothing to do with the actual repair.

Because, regardless of your pain, beneath the surface the system is active. blood, nutrients, and immune cells are flooding the zone. Collagen fibers are being produced to rebuild and remodel the damaged tissue.

In the political sense, inflammatory reactions—such as an outbreak of violence, tit-for-tat retaliatory strikes, inflammatory rhetoric, or internal crackdowns - are signs of underlying tensions or fractures within a political body.

And while there are borders between countries, neighboring states are necessarily co-mingled into an organic system, whether they like it or not.

There’s always border leak, even if it’s by osmosis.

We can say that inflammatory symptoms are manifestations of the system’s inability to maintain stability.

Because, for any body there’s a steady state, or homeostatic condition of relative balance and equilibrium. 

Once the balance disrupted you’re prone to get positive feedback loops and chaotic effects.

In other words, disorder and instability.

Expressed as inflammation.

Now, treating the inflammatory symptoms might work at first, but over time the acute inflammation becomes a chronic condition. 

And, as every aging athlete with knee issues knows, it’s way harder to repair a chronic injury than an acute injury.

Which is one reason that the metaphor works better for a case like the Middle East. 

The underlying cause of the inflammatory symptoms have clearly developed into a chronic condition. 

We can look back and try to understand at what point it would have been possible to make an intervention that removed the sources of acute inflammation, maybe sometime around the 1920s? 

But, calling for more ice, rest, and raising of the limb for inflammation relief would be ridiculous and clearly counter productive. 

Some say that a chronic injury can sometimes be healed by an acute injury.

The acute injury can supposedly reset or reignite the body’s natural healing processes, increasing blood flow and bringing attention back to the injured area, potentially breaking down old scar tissue and promoting repair.

Anyway, this is a metaphor, but since human beings only really consciously operate by language, metaphors are crucial. 

Here, I think, we can see how an alternative metaphor might reorient the conversation.

Inflammation as a metaphor forces a consideration of underlying issues and recognizes that the treatment of surface symptoms might not be sufficient.

Metastasis is another bio-medical metaphor that could be useful to the American power elite.

### Metastasize

Most people are familiar with the word metastasize as a bad thing, perhaps the worst thing.

The metaphor of course derives from the way that cancer cells spread through the body.

But, to Metastasize is not only to spread, it’s also a condition of change, simultaneous to the spreading and expansion.

To Metastasize isn’t just a movement from one place to another, but it’s transformation along the way.

This is a systemic metaphor for a complex set of relations.

Jake Sullivan or Antony Blinken might be induced to say, “Our goal is to prevent this conflict from Metastasizing.” 

Which would make sense, because when something Metastasizes, it seeps into new environments, adapting to each one, altering both itself and its environment.

The Iranian revolution of 1979 metastasized into a new environment ,Lebanon, mutating into a new phenomenon, namely, Hezbollah.

A true statement. 

In 1980 or so, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran, came to Lebanon and set up a Shiite militia where none previously existed. Now, it’s Hezbollah.

Metastasis is a process of mutation—where the original form evolves as it moves.

Adapts to a new environment, from the prostate to the pelvic bone, from Iran to Lebanon.

It isn’t like an escalator, with its fixed direction—up or down.

Or inflammation, which flares up in one place and then subsides with time.

Metastasis is less predictable, more chaotic.

Another advantage of this metaphor - when discussing geopolitics - is that in the process of dealing with Metastasis you need to account for time. 

As soon as a diagnosis is made, the clock starts ticking.

It’s a chronological process, the endpoint of which is a fundamentally altered system where the entire zone has mutated out of control.

So, in dealing with Metastasis, decisive action of some sort is certainly going to be necessary.

---

The metastasizing phenomenon (cancer or revolution, or democracy) integrates itself into new tissues, changing its nature and the nature of what surrounds it.

Consider how Lebanon has changed over the past several decades of Revolutionary Iranian Metastasis.

Metastasis spreads like a network, finding hidden pathways through social veins that ignore artificially created political borders.

Tensions, ideologies, and fears flow through borders, through economies, through the narratives people tell each other.

Just one of the interesting things about using metaphors is what they do or don’t allow you to say.

Metastasis is not something you can reverse with a simple call for de-escalation.

Once something has metastasized, it has already shifted beyond its original form.

The system itself has been altered.

It’s no longer about managing a single point of tension—it’s about understanding how the problem has woven itself into the fabric.

How the original issue has spread, mutated, and become something new.

### The USA Centric World

Coming back to the escalation metaphor, its origins in Vietnam, and the extended use it’s getting at the moment in relation to the Middle East and Ukraine.

It is possible to also see this metaphorical abuse simply as a reflection of an American wish to remain uninvolved. 

A fundamentally USA centric point of view.

Which is sort of fair enough I suppose. 

The White House simply doesn’t want to escalate, in the sense of projecting an escalator over the ocean to the Middle East, or to Europe. 

It’s a little late, and it’s irresponsible.

Certainly in the case of the Middle East, where much of the Iranian Metastasis owes it’s initial mutations to the American folly in Iraq.

But, in this reading, The American power elite are not so much speaking to the Israelis and Ukrainians, as having an internal dialogue with themselves about escalation. 

And, since they’ve already de-escalated in their own minds, why would their embattled allies trust them? 

Would the Israelis or Ukrainians like to suffer the fate of other partners of American de-escalation?

I bet not.

We’ll see how it goes, but I’m not going to be surprised if the tail wags the dog on this one.
