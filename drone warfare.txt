### True Drone Warfare is not a Gun Fight.

In other words, there’s something about drone warfare that makes it different from a regular legacy battle, or a gunfight.

That something, has to do with time and space, and asymmetries of power.

More specifically, it’s how the drones - unmanned aerial vehicles - are networked sensor platforms capable of lingering or loitering for extended periods of time.

Weirdly, the development of modern drone warfare comes along with other developments in asymmetric war. 

The relationship is of circular causality, meaning one doesn’t come before the other, they emerge together.

A formally weaker enemy adjusts by extending war both in time, by avoiding punctual contact, and in space, by denying the stronger side a formal battlefield - disappearing into the civilian population.

This could describe classic guerrilla tactics, i know. 

But, 50 years ago destroying an entire village to get at the guerrillas was pretty unremarkable.

Today, the stronger force runs the risk of having their leaders arrested by an international court of criminal law. So, things have actually changed.

Call in the drone.

It’s highly possible that the abuse of “Lawfare” will lead to a weakening of international agreements, but that’s speculative at the moment.

Back to the gunfight and why it’s different.

A gunfight is a situation where you are shooting at someone who’s shooting back at you. 

It is contained in time and place. 

Which is why battles are often named for places.

Even though there are some very long battles…

The battle of Verdun in 1916 lasted for 302 days. But it wasn’t so much more complicated than two lines of soldiers fighting each other. 

Around 700,000 soldiers were killed during that battle.

Which only attests to the stupidity of a legacy officer class who’s job was to get their underlings killed.

Weirdly that’s what gentlemanly warfare was about. The bravery of the soldiers and the sadism of officers.

The battle of Verdun was definitely an epic gunfight.

A situation where you are shooting at someone who’s shooting back at you. 

Contained in time and place. 

In a gunfight, you shoot at the other gun fighter.

Plus whatever they bring with them. Horses, cars, help, lawnmowers, machine guns, whatever. 

Anything in the way gets blasted, like in a cowboy movie.

A gun battle can take place between two individual humans with guns.

Or two million individuals with guns and artillery, like the Battle of Verdun.

And it’s still a gun battle when there are tanks involved. Bigger guns are still guns. 

And even if you add in manned and unmanned air craft, helicopters, boats, grenades, and maybe a military dog, it’s still going to be a gun battle.

Contained in time and place.

Maybe a more complex gun battle, maybe a more destructive gun battle. 

But it’s a battle between two sides, destroying targets that present themselves on the battle field. 

And sticking for a minute to drones, the addition of an unmanned aerial vehicle to a battle isn’t a game changer in and of itself. 

If it’s a Kamikaze drone, or a drone that’s being used for battle field reconnaissance, it doesn’t change the very nature of war.

Sure, it’s either really useful or a serious bummer if you or the enemy sent a First Person View drone loaded with 300 grams of TNT to buzz down a trench and take out a couple of infantrymen, or an armored vehicle.

But it’s no different than if that’d been done with an RPG or a grenade thrown by a soldier, or a helicopter or anti-tank missile attack on the position.

You see what I’m saying?

The fact that the delivery of a kinetic strike was performed by an unmanned aerial vehicle is only slightly interesting. 

Because, even back in the French Revolution they were sending things up in the sky for reconnaissance. Hot air balloons with spotters up there holding telescopes. 

Today drones have excellent optics and special sensors, but at the end of the day, this is not in and of itself a fundamentally different thing from a couple of guys in a hot air balloon.

Sure, the information is delivered faster into a network. 

But, those capabilities alone do not indicate a new **genre** of warfare.

### Deep Drone Time

What the drone really managed to change was the definition of what makes a viable target in warfare. 

You can have a fleet of drones up in the air, focused upon a constrained and defined area for an extended period of time.

Days, weeks, months.

The drone’s reconnoitering capabilities include this deep time dimension.

Crossed with a sort of massive attention and focus.

Call it drone time. 

A fighter jet moves too fast. 

A helicopter is too noisy and expensive to run.

A drone can just circle there at 5,000 feet. Aiming its sensors at a tightly defined spot.

And from that height nobody can hear or see it. The drone is loitering.

That’s the technical term for this. “To loiter”. 

The drone can **loiter** for long periods of time.

And if you’ve got a couple of them you can loiter permanently.

Drone loitering patrols overlap, creating potentially 24/7 coverage of an entire city.

And recording, and remembering.

Sending captured data back to the computers, humming and blinking back in a data center.

And figuring out what’s going on.

Cataloging and processing information on people.

Who they meet and where they go.

And figuring out who and what to kill next.

What’s the target?

So this is the big difference between drone warfare and legacy war.

A drone network can produce targets over time from within a mixed civilian and military population.

### The Target

Identifying targets is a necessity.

It’s almost a metaphysical requirement, and not just in warfare.

You need to know what you’re aiming at.

In the legacy version of a gun battle, the target **presents itself** on the battlefield. Literally.

Most times, the target was a person in a uniform within a geographical zone that’s more or less understood as a battlefield.

Or even a known figure like a general, or a president or a deputy commander.

In which case you can call it a “named” target.

In World War two, just as in the Napoleonic battle field, the targets were pretty clear. 

And if the target became confusing, the armies involved would sometimes just massacre an entire village.

You know. Collective punishment and reprisals.

As i’ve mentioned earlier.

Sometimes they’d carpet bomb a city, or fire bomb enemy civilians in the hope that everyone would just lost their desire for war.

After the second world war, institutions were set up to regulate the battlefield. 

Supposedly to prevent future instances of civilian massacre on the scales seen during and leading up to the war.

One of the unintended consequence of this internationally agreed regulation of warfare was the development of so called “Lawfare”.

Today there’s an old new trick, on the asymmetrical battlefield.

You hide among civilians.

Targets no longer so obviously present themselves on the battlefield.

And in many cases, the battlefield disappears from geographical reality.

But with the kind of drone warfare I’m talking about, none of this means that the battlefield is gone

### Ukraine

I should just mention the situation in Ukraine.

Both sides use relatively large drones as guided missiles on military and civilian targets.

Both sides use crews of drone operators close to the front line. 

The front line crews use FPV, or first person view goggles to pilot racing drones fitted with explosives. 

Or to drop grenades.

They go around hunting enemy soldiers.

And enemy soldiers do the same to them. 

Each of the sides have teams that go out hunting for the drone operation teams on the other side. 

Brutal, war.

But not exceptionally different to say, artillery.

Essentially these are static forces, well dug in, with very little movement of the lines.

You could say of course, that there’s certainly an increased use in remote controlled objects.

Drones or whatever. 

But it’s not an earth shattering change in the nature of war.

### Iraq

True drone warfare is something different. 

It requires air superiority, loitering cameras, data capturing and computational capabilities.

This kind of drone warfare really starts in Iraq around 2006, during the so called “surge”. 

The Americans ran out of targets, and the insurgents slipped into the civilian population.

So, some smart American soldiers working with the CIA began to use the drone’s loitering and sensor capabilities combined with spreadsheets to… notice things.

Then they’d note down the things they noticed.

Over time, they’d add up what had been noticed and start using that accumulated information to generate targets. 

This initial transition can be understood as moving from the named strike - hitting a named individual, to a signature strike - hitting an individual who’s name you don’t know, but who’s profile of activities and connections, the so called ***signature***, transformed him into a target by the drone system.

And it makes zero difference if the calculations for this are made with or without computers. Of course, computers now can make it all happen faster. Also, many of the routine calculations, or algorithmic decisions, can be automated.

In other words you can use Artificial Intelligence for this stuff now.

But, back then, American troops in Iraq would take that spreadsheet information, and go kicking down doors to capture insurgents.

- Who were sent to Abu Ghraib.
- Got tortured by demented American guards.
- And developed into the leadership of ISIS.

But that’s a whole different story.

What we can see right now in Gaza and Lebanon is a sort of quantum leap from that initial development of drone war, into a kind of warfare specific and true to the drone. 

### The Gaza War

In retrospect it’s possible to understand how the Israelis took their eye off the ball in Gaza, prior to October 7th, 2023.

We can understand that because of how their eye was literally glued to the ball up north, in Lebanon. 

Hizbollah was essentially check mated and the IDF might have had them at mate-in-one for a long time. I guess they were constantly wondering when they’d be able to push the pager button on them.

So preoccupied were they with the Hizbollah threat, that they failed to prepare for an infantry invasion by Hamas.

Because they didn’t even imagine that Hamas was capable of it.

Which was a big mistake, obviously.

But, none of this meant that Hamas had a chance, once the IDF got rolling again. 

And drone warfare goes a long way to explaining why.

The IDF has developed a number of overlapping intelligence systems that use drones as a main platform for capturing data that can be input into the program. 

Other inputs are from smart phones, CCTV cameras, human intelligence, financial transactions, whatever else the IDF can get, basically. 

But it’s the unmanned aerial drone systems that can be put in action and directed anywhere and everywhere for as long as the intelligence people wish. 

Aerial drones are a highly focused and mobile surveillance platform.

Consequently, when it came time to go after Hamas in Gaza they had both pre-existing targets, and targets that were produced in real time by the system. 

The initial airstrike campaign began on 7th of October and lasted several weeks until a ground operation was launched. 

Around late November, Hamas was saying (through this thing that they called a health ministry) that around 40,000 people had been killed in Gaza. They didn’t distinguish between Military and Civilian casualties.

As of 29 October 2024, 43,061 Palestinians were reportedly killed in Gaza.

Which means that over a few weeks, around 40,000 people were killed in Gaza.

And over the past year of continued warfare, another 3,000 odd people have been killed in Gaza.

There are two points here that I’m trying to make. 

First, the main killing in Gaza happened during short and intense kinetic events in the middle weeks of October 2023. 

This is counterfactual to the perception of an intense year long war in Gaza. The main events were finished quickly with the initial strikes.

Which leads to the Second point. In order to conduct those strikes, they needed massive intelligence on Hamas operatives to target.

The reason that they had such a large target bank was because of their drone system, code named Lavender.

### Lavender

Lavender is reportedly an AI system that takes in heterogeneous inputs from a variety of sources, including real time drone surveillance. 

Essentially this system catalogs the entire population of a territory like Gaza - 2 million or so people - and performs a behavioral analysis to rate people as either Hamas affiliated, or not.

Every person in Gaza is in the system.

Just like a credit score, Lavender rates the population. I’m not entirely sure how it works, if it gives people a score of 1 to 100 or 0 to a thousand. Point is, everyone is surveilled and analyzed and given a score in terms of the likelihood that they are members of Hamas. 

This is clearly unnecessary for those who are middle to high members of Hamas, since they are already known. I mentioned the idea of named strikes versus signature strikes earlier. Lavender is all about the signature strike.

One IDF source said that “At its peak, the system managed to generate 37,000 people as potential human targets.”

The IDF insists that Lavender is not automated, that it’s an intelligence assistant to human agents who analyze and make the final decision of who gets on the list. 

This is disputed and we have no way of knowing that actual details.

Another tracking system is called “Where’s Daddy”. 

By tracking Hamas members to their homes “Where’s Daddy” lets the IDF know when a member of the group has returned home, and can be targeted.

In the initial weeks of the October 7th war, thousands of targets that the drone systems had generated were hit. 

Critics of these systems say that, Lavender for example, had only a 90% reliability in pre-war testing conducted by the IDF.

But of course, in war a 90% probability of being correct is excellent, however terrible that is for the unlucky ten percent.

One of the more perverse effects of having systems like these are the way it interacts with what I’ve already mentioned earlier as “Lawfare”.

### AI and Lawfare

It isn’t only the weaker parties in asymmetric warfare who engage in Lawfare.

If the international rules of legal warfare are crystalized into law, then an AI system’s probable accuracy can be calibrated to fall just short of a war crime.

It all really depends upon what proportion of civilian to combat deaths are considered acceptable. 

- Of course, the law of proportionality in international war isn’t about the ratio of enemy dead to your own dead.
- It’s about the aims of a particular military operation, and to what degree the urgency of the action justifies civilian deaths in addition to the military target.

The point is that an AI system can help to analyze a strike, say on an apartment building. 

**The “Lavender”** system identifies someone as being Hamas affiliated

**“Where’s Daddy”** says the guy’s entering his home.

A mix of computers and real time observation says it’s likely you’ll kill five or ten civilians if you do it.

They refer this to a legal advisor.

Who makes a decision based upon some other calculation, which include an overall estimation of civilian to combatant death ratios. 

They look at the numbers, estimations and statistics accumulating in real time. Some legal advisor says, “were good. Do it”.

Let’s take a look at civilian to combatant death ratios.

---

The proportion of civilian to combatant deaths in the Iraq war exceeded 70%.

- For every legitimate combatant killed, 2.3 civilians were killed.

In the Syrian civil war the proportion of civilian to combatant killed is estimated at 6 to 1. 6 civilians killed for every combatant.

- That’s a very high ratio.

While the absolute numbers of world war 2 dead were shocking, the civilian to combatant killed ratio was 2:1. 

- That includes the holocaust and the nuclear strikes on Japan.
- 2 civilians for every 1 combatant killed.

If both the Hamas health ministry **and** the IDF are to be believed, then 26,800 civilians have been killed out of the total numbers give. The remaining 15,000 dead are Hamas combatants. 

- Therefore, The proportion of civilian to combatant deaths in the Gaza war is estimated at 1.79 civilians for every combatant killed.

---

In any case, the point here isn’t that this is a wonderful world filled with peace loving people.

It’s just to say that this method of fighting war using drone technologies is pretty new.

It’s not confined to the Israelis either, of course. But, at the moment they’re the ones pioneering many aspects of these networked weapons.

One thing that should be pretty obvious here is that the techniques of drone warfare can be generalized away from the battlefield to the internal civil realm.

These techniques are capable of producing targets on a large scale - even within civilian territory - combined with an element of Lawfare as the system strives to maintain the enemy dead within a certain ratio of civilian to combatant.

### Civil War

This kind of drone warfare wouldn’t be possible between peer competitors. Russia and Ukraine aren’t fighting this way.

It’s more suitable to The Americans in Iraq, or the Israelis in Gaza and the West Bank.

Put simply, this is suitable to a civil situation. Where one side has an overwhelming technological advantage, and another side has a kind of demographic advantage. 

Like they’re willing to get their people killed. Using civilian casualties and the mediatization, or spectacularization of their asymmetry as a weapon of war. 

But, as we can see both sides can play at ***Lawfare***.

Which to me, means that with the advent of drone warfare, this kind of conflict runs the risk of being semi-permanent.

And of slipping in to the ways that internal conflicts are fought. 

It isn’t so hard to imagine a highly networked surveillance system being turned inwards, on a population by their own government. 

Maybe you could fall onto that target bank because of where you go for dinner. and then fall off it by breakfast for some other reason.

The thresholds are arbitrary and ever changing. 

Simply modulated according to the whim of a sovereign. 

Scary stuff.

---

I’ll conclude by trying to break this out into more recognizable political terms.

I said earlier that the need for a target is an almost a metaphysical condition. 

You need to know what you’re aiming at.

This is no doubt true for any endeavor which aims to be accurate, fair, or legal.

If you don’t know what your target is, how can you operate a war, statecraft, or a legal system without becoming arbitrary.

### From WAR TO LAW

Let’s move from WAR TO LAW for a minute.

There are interesting distinctions between the English Common Law system, and the Civil Law system of continental Europe. 

The English Common Law system is practiced in many countries around the world. These are generally considered to be the “Liberal” countries.

- United States
- UK
- Canada
- Australia
- New Zealand
- India
- Hong Kong
- Israel

As early as the 13th century, the English developed a legal system centered around the rights of the individual. This sounds sort of simple to say, but it was totally revolutionary.

The idea of ***Habeas Corpus*** is at the center of this liberal revolution.

This term is simply Latin for “You shall have the body”. 

Which means, that the state is not allowed to take someone into arbitrary detention without a due process.

The courts shall have the body.

The detaining authority must justify the legality of the detention.

The entire system develops around this recognition that it’s only reason for existing is the protection of individual rights. 

So, the individual human being is the axis around which the legal system of English Common law revolves.

By contrast, French Civil Law, deriving from the Napoleonic code, is the basis of most European legal systems. 

There is no precise equivalent of Habeas Corpus.  

In the Civil Law System, the target of legal structure is the collective, not the individual.

Japanese legal culture for example, emphasizes harmony, social order, and the collective good over individual rights.

In other parts of the world the legal systems are hybrids, taking elements of Civil Law, or Common Law (used in business disputes for example), and adopting Islamic Sharia or other customary judicial systems for family or civil matters. 

Other systems are simply theocratic, Iran and Saudi Arabia for example.

### Drone

Back to Drone Warfare.

War is not the same as Civil Law.

Obviously.

Which is one reason that war is the arena where new technologies of power get tested, because it’s usually illegal to use them on your own people.

But, it is equally well known that military technologies boomerang back to the civil societies that mobilize them in the first place.

So it’s important to know what’s boomeranging back to us.

What’s coming back at us here in the liberal world, is a retreat from the basic principle of English Common law.

When an operation of power is aimed at a named target, it is generally speaking in harmony with liberal principles that protect the individual. 

The law is required to “show the body”, when operating on a target. 

Therefore, the target of power must be named.

What we can see in the kinds of drone warfare that i’ve outlined earlier, is an altogether different operation of power.

Drone warfare as we can understand it in Gaza or in the Iraq war mobilizes power against bodies that are not yet named or recognized. 

A set of behavioral or circumstantial signatures transforms a person into a target of power, before their names are known to the state, or the military, or police.

Power operates on the body before a body is even available to be shown. 

So, in a way you can say that the target of a drone strike isn’t actually a real body yet, it’s a virtual body.

Habeas Virtus

or

Habeas Simulacrum

And in truth, It takes them a while to figure out who the actual person is.

At least in the American version of drone warfare, in Iraq and Afghanistan, the unmanned aerial vehicle often loitered over the site of a signature missile strike for up to a month, observing and tracking until they figure out exactly who they killed. 

Which means that the body is produced only after power has been exercised.

Anyway.

I am generally supportive of the Israeli war in Gaza.

I understand that it was necessary to operate against Hamas.

And the initial strikes against Hamas targets were obviously effective and prevented more Israelis from being killed when they did go in on the ground.

Which by the way is the fundamental issue in the rules around proportionality.

That said, I’m also aware that the mode of warfare we can see there is dangerous for a couple of reasons.

First, it makes it easier to conduct operations within civilian areas.

- And of course, I want to recognize that the need to do this isn’t simply the fault of the Israelis. It’s the fundamental strategy of both Hamas and Hizballah to operate among a civilian population that they use as lawfare shields.
- But this capacity to generate targets from an entirely catalogued population is certainly concerning when you consider my second point.

It’s inevitable that this technique of exerting power will boomerang back home.

Actually, I think it already has, in a major way.

But that’s the subject of another podcast.
