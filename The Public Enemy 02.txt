The Public Enemy 02
---

### Intro

This is the second of a two part series in which I ruminate upon the strange phenomenon of people in liberal democracies, like the USA, UK, France, etc, supporting Hamas in the wake of the October 7 massacre in Israel and the ensuing war.

If you haven’t listened to the first installment, you probably should do so before continuing here.

Much of the first part was focused upon defining what it is that had actually happened on October 7th, and to some degree responding to the question of “context” which is often raised by people who wish to make excuses for the Hamas massacre.

To make a long story short, my position is that there’s no possible excuse for the Hamas massacre. Nor, would there be a contextual excuse for any massacre of that nature, regardless of who committed it

My own confusion is really stuck on how it is possible that so many people in western liberal democracies do not intuitively make a link between their own publics, and the Israeli public. 

---

### The Polls

Here’s a break down of what I can find in the polling on this matter, just to put it into perspective. 

In the US of A, Around 58% of people polled a few months ago thought that Israel had valid reasons for fighting Hamas. 

And, slightly over 20% of people thought that Hamas had valid reasons for fighting Israel. 

Over in the UK things are different. 

A recent IPSOS poll in the UK found that a majority of Britons believe that Israel is more responsible for the war than Hamas. 

Breaking it down, 30% believe that Israel is responsible for the war, and 27% think Hamas is. 

A full 21% said they didn’t know.

Now, what the fuck is that all about?

Given that it was Hamas who attacked Israel about a year ago, not the other way around, this is really hard to understand. Unless the brits are so sophisticated that they’ve managed to turn things around intellectually so that they see upside down as right side up.

Which appears to be the case. 

You see what I’m dealing with over here?

So how to explain the serious delirium this side of the pond?

Is it simply a failure of Israeli explanatory power?

Or the fruit of pro-Islamist propaganda?

Well, my general thesis is that the incoherence about Palestine and Israel is symptomatic of a fundamental Nihilism that has crept over the “public space”. 

It looks to me as if it’s connected to education. The more highly educated people are, the more warped are their perceptions of the world. 

This seems to be because higher education imparts in students a “secret” knowledge. 

Particularly in the humanities, they are propelled into a demented obstacle course of intellectual acrobatics, resulting in them having learned a so called “language of critique”. In doing so, they gain access to what I’m referring a “secret knowledge”.

I know this because I did my PhD in London. I speak the language of critique and understand this secret knowledge.

What highly educated people are not being taught are the basics of how we have arrived at the point in the history of humanity where they are allowed the liberty to have such a secret knowledge.

These highly educated elites are concentrated in cities like London, New York, L.A., San Fran, etc.

So, in order to understand the phenomenon, I’ll go back to the city.

---

### The City

Cities and suburbs have grown a lot over the last century or so, in developed countries, or whatever you want to call them, advanced economies, the global north. 

People are together, living in the city or the burbs, yet they don’t actually know each other. 

Which is as much a feature as it is a bug.

We are free, liberated from having to really know each other.

Essentially we’re ships passing in the night. 

Sure, there are many people in a city the size of London who do not live there by choice.

Same in New York or any other city.

But those aren’t my people. 

That’s not my case.

Those aren’t my friends or acquaintances. 

The people who I most frequently interact with have chosen to live in London, or New York.

This is my public.

New York and London are dynamic cities, plugged into the globalized economy. 

Or you might say, drivers of the globalized economy.

These cities attract all kinds of ambitious people who work in technology, finance, the arts, whatever. 

A large part of the attraction is a kind of radical openness. 

You can be whoever you want to be. 

Which sounds cheesy but to a large extent is both historically true and relatively unique.

The globalized city is a place that valorizes activity over essence.

Meaning… 

In London or New York, **who** you are is less important than **what** you do.

Activity over essence.

Nobody’s trying to understand your essence.

This is one kind of freedom, and it’s an amazing accomplishment.

Given how people have lived for most of recorded history, in clans, tribes, strictly hierarchical systems of oppression, castes, and in gender apartheid.

There are still many places on earth where you don’t choose who you marry, and having a fun girlfriend is likely to get you and her both murdered.

And there aren’t so many places on earth where the kind of freedom we have in London or New York, or Tel Aviv can be experienced.

Which gets to the heart of what I’m on about.

### The Crux

You’d expect the publics of those places to have shared values.

You’d expect the lucky people who get to live in London and New York to have compassion for those in Tel Aviv. To understand the connections between them.

I’ll tell you one thing for free. The people who live in Tel Aviv are hyper aware of these connections.

But, given the reactions of people around me here in London, after October 7th 2023, this seems to be a one way relationship, like unrequited love.

So, who are these fucking people, spurning their liberal minded brothers and sisters?

What about here, are we a “public”? 

Are these morally confused people my public?

By **My Public**, I’m not trying to be all Barbra Streisand about this. 

I mean the people who I had considered to be my people, cosmopolitan, liberal, educated citizens of the globalized western metropolis.

Now, the confused situation made me reconsider what all of this means.

I began to get this strange feeling, walking around in public. 

Which makes me think of Freud’s idea of the **Uncanny, (*Unheimlich*** in German).

Something, or someone, is uncanny when it generates a feeling of unease because it’s both familiar and alien. 

Like, you see someone you think you know, but you don’t know them.

A resemblance can be “uncanny”.

This might be how I’m feeling now, walking around in my neighborhood. 

The public here feels simultaneously alien yet deeply familiar.

I get a sense of deep unease and even dread. 

In other words, I’m alienated.

Which isn’t great.

So, I’m wondering actually, what is this thing called “The Public”. 

Who are they?

---

### The Public

Although there are many publics, the kind of public I wish to discuss here is a people or group sharing a ***common political identity***.

A **Political** **identity** is formed through shared values, history, culture, and a sense of belonging to a political order.

The **common political identity** that I assumed we shared is oriented around pluralist values of tolerance, open mindedness, self determination, curiosity, education, intolerance of bigotry, and the acceptance of difference.  

This is a common political identity that I associate with globalized cities such as New York, Paris, and London, where I live. 

But, more generally it’s a common political identity shared by **other pluralist societies**, like the United States, Sweden, France, Israel, and the UK, among a limited club of other sovereign territories that have based their political order on “PLURALIST” values. 

Otherwise known as liberal values.

Which implies a decision. 

Some people, at some point in time, decided they wanted to construct a pluralist society, as open as possible given the various constraints.

Israel is constructed as an open, pluralist society, despite its never ending security challenges. 

The majority of Israelis see themselves and their country in this way.

The majority of Israelis see themselves as part of this club of pluralist societies.

Many Israelis think that the pluralist nature of their society is under threat.

Just like many people in the USA and UK and France think the same.

### The Luck of a Pluralist Society

For most people it’s better to live in a pluralist society.

If you doubt that this is true, ask yourself why nobody you know is just dying to go live in Russia, Iran, China, North Korea, Egypt, etc. 

In those place, the people who wished to construct a pluralist society are dead, dying, imprisoned, exiled, or just keeping very very quiet about it.

You get my point.

Pluralist, open societies exist, because their opposite, illiberal and closed societies also exist.

It’s probably true that no society is a hundred percent open and pluralist.

There are limits to what even the tolerant can tolerate. 

I’m not claiming utopia here.

People in closed societies aren’t suffering a hundred percent of the time either.

A few of these closed societies do seem quite dystopian though.

Thinking of North Korea and Iran…

Anyway, back to my uncanny public here.

For most people, being able to live in an pluralist society is a matter of luck. 

Thinking globally, you know, within the 8 billion or so people on earth, how many are able to live in a place like London?

The answer is, not very many.

Some very small percentage of the world live in what’s known as “open societies”.

So you’d think that those of us lucky enough to live in an open society (as flawed as it might be), would recognize how exceptional these conditions are, and who are friends were.

The ability to live in an open society is one of the true rarities. 

An ***open society*** is defined by pluralism and equality before the law, by an independent judiciary and transparency and accountability of government. 

I’m going to break this down so it’s VERY clear:

- **Pluralism**: Multiple groups coexist and have a voice in society.
- **Equality before the law**: Everyone is treated the same by legal systems.
- **Independent judiciary**: Courts operate without government influence.
- **Transparency**: Government actions are open and clear to the public.
- **Accountability**: Government is answerable to the people for its actions.

---

### **Civilization**

Another term I could use for an open society would be Civilized.

The term civilization didn’t come out of the computer game from the 1990s.

The notion of Civilization emerges in the late 18th century enlightenment as an aspiration to produce political spaces that are distinct from Barbarism. 

This is an enlightenment dichotomy, *civilization* or barbarism.

The root of this idea coming from the Greek and Roman “civilizations”. 

The Greek term *civis* distinguished between the political order of a polis, or city, and the nomadic or tribal life of the barbarians.

---

The shared values of an open society are recognized on the diplomatic level.

Technically, Israel, the UK, USA, France, Italy, Sweden, etc are on the same side. 

But go walk down the streets of London or New York, and you’re getting a different picture. 

Now…

At the same time, each and every one of the values associated to an Open Society, is specifically rejected by the perpetrators of the October 7th massacre and their regional supporters. 

Call them what they are, **Public Enemies.**

The **common political identity** of Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, is the polar opposite of western, globalized, liberal values. 

So, being that this seems pretty obvious, you’d think that The lucky Public of a city like London would take the side of a public like that of Israel, who by and large share the same values.

Particularly when they’re massacred on live streamed video by a horde of fucking barbarians.

But, that doesn’t seem to be the case. 

Which led me to the question of why and how **common political identities** that weren’t tribal or sectarian came to be formed in the first place, since they seem fragile now.

---

### Public Identity

A public shares a **Political** **identity.**

And, a political identity is formed through shared values, history, culture, and a sense of belonging to a political order.

I’ve discussed the shared values, and hopefully i’m making *some* sense.

What about political order?

When I say “political order”, I just mean the way that a political system maintains stability and structure. 

Partly, political order is a function of a sovereign. The sovereign state for example, is supposed to guarantee the political order. 

And while there can be a multiplicity of publics within The Public of a sovereign state, the political order of a sovereign state is in theory singular.

Like, you’ve got multiple publics, within a singular political order. 

The order of the sovereign state.

This is the case because of the way that the planet earth has come to be organized into an international system. Agreements and relations between sovereign entities recognize the political legitimacy of state sovereigns.

Taking France as an example, the political order of today’s sovereign state of France is both inclusive and exclusive.

If you live in New Zealand, or Zambia, and have no connection to France, you cannot just up and decide to be part of The French Public. 

The sovereign decides upon inclusion or exclusion of the political order. 

If the French sovereign wanted to include all Burundians tomorrow, they could. They wouldn’t even have to ask the permission of Burundi.

Funny hypothetical since it’s possible that three quarters or more of Burundi would move to France the next day if they could.

To complicate matters, excluded populations inside of a sovereign territory will at the same time necessarily be included in its political order, as an excluded population. 

Do you know what I mean?

French Citizens and legal residents (including immigrants) are included within the political order of France. They are “members of The Public”. Other groups, like asylum seekers, or illegal immigrants, are only included within the political order as an exclusion. They aren’t **members** of “The Public”. 

Back in the day, women, jews, slaves, were all at one time or another considered an excluded inclusion, certainly not members of the public. Of course, this remains true in many places on earth unfortunately.

**But,** in France, as in the UK, or United States, Israel, or Sweden, formal inclusion in the political order today is unrelated to race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual persuasion, etc.

Yes, also in Israel.

### The Sovereign State

Anyway, what I’m trying to get to here is that transforming sectarian, clan, and tribal multiplicities into a pluralist **public** by way of the sovereign state was neither a given, nor very pretty, and certainly not bloodless.

France, the UK, the United States, and all **successful sovereign states** of the world, have managed by some miracle to produce large publics who ***shared a common political identity***.

Why is it a miracle?

Because the creation of the Sovereign State ended the incessant civil wars that have plagued human geographies not under the thumb of a pacifying hegemony. 

When it gets the mix right, the successful pluralist state guarantees security and equality for all in front of the law. 

Which is pretty fucking amazing.

The sovereign state creates the conditions for the emergence of a Public that transcends sectarian and ethnic divisions. 

It is connected to a secular movement away from theocracy.

Remember the idea of a separation of church and state?

That’s an essential move.

But, the creation of a pluralist Public space, has always and everywhere been accomplished by suppressing sectarian politics that compete with the possibility of a common political identity.

At the time of World War 1, only around half of the people living in the sovereign state of France were fluent in the French language.

The French territory had at least 55 major dialects, none of which really sounded the same. 

A person living in the North West of France wasn’t even able to have a conversation with someone in the South East, unless both of them were of an educated elite who spoke French.

It took a massive and concerted effort over a few centuries for the Parisian elites to complete the colonization of this territory and turn it into the French sovereign state that we now recognize as a single political entity.

Consider that when someone extols the virtue of French culture, literature or cuisine.

The entire power of the state needed to dedicate itself to this end. Educational policies, particularly around language, grammar, and a strict historical narrative were focused to the goal of **nation building**. 

And when that didn’t work, brute military force was employed. Just take one example, the war of Vendee, in western France. Hundreds of thousands were killed by the French Revolutionary forces, and after their armies defeated the conservative armies, they destroyed villages and massacred their inhabitants.

Italy, Germany, Japan, Russia, Spain, Turkey, are all national projects that were more or less contemporaneous with the French. 

All sovereign states were created this way.

In every case the experience was different, but a lot of blood was spilled as linguistic and cultural norms were imposed by state institutions to create a political order necessary to sustain **a public**.

This was the original “Nation Building” program that was actually effective to produce political order and publics that were more than a collection of sectarian tribes. 

Today it’s called ethnic cleansing.

---

### The Arab World

This necessity to impose a political order has not only been true for the great powers mentioned above.

It was also true for the territories that were transitioned to state sovereignty by colonial European powers following the first world war.

Now we turn to the Arab world.

Once the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires had been defeated and taken apart, the British and the French essentially managed a transition to state sovereignty for ex imperial political territories like Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Palestine, and Jordan. 

An international system had developed which connected sovereign states to each other through institutions like the League of Nations, and now, the United Nations. 

These newly sovereign countries have vigorously engaged in Nation Building.

The result so far is a mixed bag of shit, mostly.

And certainly hasn’t produced either a pluralist state, or even the evident desire for one.

The Arab world is famously divided between the Sunni and Shia Muslim sects, as well as ethnic divisions like the Kurds, Druze, and Christians. And within the sectarian groupings are tight clan divisions. 

This is still the case today.

For example, just one Sunni Arab clan in Jordan might have 400,000 members, or more.

Those people are loyal firstly to their tribe.

Those post-colonial states who have managed to more or less put down ethnic, sectarian, and tribal power within sovereign state borders, continue to require brutal suppression with varying degrees of military and police power. 

I’m thinking here of Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey.

The others, like Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon hang by a thread. 

Let’s take Iraq as a first example.

For most of Iraq’s short existence as a sovereign state a Sunni minority imposed itself on a large Shia majority and a Kurdish minority, among other sects, and ethnicities. 

All institutions of the Iraqi state were mobilized in suppressing resistance to the Sunni minority, who eventually formalized politically as the Baath party, a quasi fascist Arab Nationalist ideology with local tribal affiliations.

Nation building measures in post-colonial Iraq included forced relocation of entire ethnic groups, as well as attempts to exterminate ethnicities using conventional military means as well as chemical weapons. 

Official policies of *Arabization* were imposed in Kurdish areas, to suppress the possibility of Kurdish secession. 

ISIS of course is a Sunni group formed from the remnants of the Baath party after the United States removed them from power in what they called a process of de-Baathification.

The same is largely true in Syria, although weirdly reversed. 

The Syrian sovereign power is an Alawite dynasty, suppressing the Sunni majority. The Alawite have a connection to Shiism. 

The civil war there begun in 2011 has been largely fought along those lines. Shia Hizbala and Iran, for example, came to the aid of the Alawite minority. 

Their goal of course is to push Shia hegemony over the middle east.

Between 2011 and 2022 more than half million people are estimated to have been murdered in the Alawite suppression of the Sunni majority.

Which is why many Sunni in Syria celebrated the death of Hizbala chief Hassan Nasrallah, recently killed in an Israeli airstrike.

The Jordanian question is interesting, only because they really had to begin with nothing.

The ruling Hashemite monarchy was literally parachuted into power by the British after world war 1. 

Parachuted because the dynasty isn’t even from Jordan, but Mecca, in today’s Saudi Arabia. The Hashemites now rule Jordan as a hereditary dynasty and are considered both a success and a blessing, since they manage to create at least some semblance of Political Order.

The Hashemite dynasty only manages to stay in power thanks to a combination of massive US support, and the cooptation of Bedouin tribes and Trans-Jordanian elites in a patronage system. 

The greatest threat to Hashemite power in Jordan is the Palestinian majority. 

Palestinians make up between 70-80% of Jordan’s population. They are excluded from service in the military and security forces, and many hundreds of thousands do not enjoy citizen rights. 

---

### Failed States

Anyway, my point in conducting this little survey is that the Nation Building project in a post colonial middle east is still a work in progress, and that’s being kind. 

There is no Arab country capable of imposing state sovereignty without direct violent repression. 

The production of large Publics that are not riven by violent sectarian, ethnic, and tribal division, has not yet proven possible.

They are very far away from pluralism, to put it politely.

For reasons that are beyond this rumination the conditions in the Arab world do not seem conducive yet for what the Marquis de Mirabeau termed ***civilisation*** in 1757.

Instead, there is widespread uncertainty, instability, and a complex and shifting political order in which a given regime attempts a semblance of sovereign power, while having to contend with the constant jockeying for influence among armed sects, tribal, and ethnic groups, each with their own internal publics, always one step away from civil war.

Despite UN representation, the sovereignty of states like Syria and Lebanon are in fact highly questionable. To what degree does the government of Lebanon possess sovereignty over the territory, given that a Shiite militia like Hezbollah is more powerful than the Lebanese army.

In other words, there are only Failed States, and Military Dictatorships in the Middle East, with a single exception.

Israel.

Think about that next time you see the ***Permanent Representative to the United Nations*** of Lebanon or Syria, or Libya, speaking with great authority about Genocide and humanitarian law.

### Public Friends and Enemies

The initial question about public identity is rooted in my experience as a person living in a quote unquote “GLOBAL CITY” following the Hamas attack on Israel, October 7th 2023. 

I’m pretty hard to shock, but the reaction around me on October 8th really did surprise me.

I naively expected that there would be widespread condemnation of Hamas, and support for Israel.

Because The Publics of Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom share the fragile circumstances by which they are able to maintain themselves as pluralist societies.

I don’t think this should be taken for granted, but it is.

The **enemy** of a public like this, is an external or internal force that would destabilize its political order.

The friend of a public like this, is an external or internal force that would stabilize its political order.

The ability to define a Public Enemy is helpful in defining a Public Friend.

What is a public that is unsure of who their friends and enemies are?

How can a public be worth defending, if it doesn’t even recognize the basic principles that ground its political order?

I’ll keep my final comment to the UK and London. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that unfortunately this once great public has lost its bearing.

Not so long ago, the public here led the way in an epic battle for a pluralist society. 

Consider the suffragettes, or the abolition of slavery, or any of the many ways that England revolutionized human collectivity around an organizing principle known as liberalism.

With a legal system constructed around the individual human being, protecting rights.

Liberalism and Pluralism were the foundation of the political order.

I don’t see that this is the case anymore.

There is no longer a collective principle that can ground its political order, besides commerce maybe.

And a political order without grounding moral principles is the textbook definition of Nihilism.

Nihilism, by eroding the very structures that help define collective identity and purpose, leads to a situation where these distinctions dissolve, and society risks becoming apathetic, fragmented, or vulnerable to authoritarianism.
