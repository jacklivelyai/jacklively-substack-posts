AI will never write a great book.

which isn’t to say that AI won’t write a book. 

Ais write books all the time. 

All day long people all over the world are creating books with AI.

Its reasonable to expect that hundreds of thousands of AI generated books are published every day on Amazon.

But that wasn’t the proposition that I began with.

I said, AI will never write a **great** book. 

By great, I mean a book that will move someone. 

A great book is read with great satisfaction. 

A great book can change someone’s life.

And AI will never write a great book.

---

This isn’t so much about what computers cannot do, as it is about what **you** can do.

and it isn’t about who you are, and who ai isn’t.

it’s about how your brain works, and about how computers work.

AI is very good at determining what’s likely to happen next.

You are very good at figuring out the thing that’s **unlikely** to happen next.

There are some misconceptions about genre fiction and the people that read those books.

Some writers convince themselves that readers are interested in genre cliches.

That readers of genre fiction love the cliches.

And it is true that there are readers out there who consume ten books a week without reflecting too much about what they’re reading.

These are the readers who ai books will be marketed to.

because those are readers who are fine with mediocrity.

And chasing mediocrity was always a tough gig.

but now in the age of artificial intelligence it’s an impossible gig.

you will lose.

---

Because, like I said, AI is very good at determining what’s likely to happen next.

And you are very good at figuring out the thing that’s **unlikely** to happen next.

A book with the most likely narrative sequence is the definition of mediocrity. 

Another word for mediocrity in fiction is **cliche**.

---

Readers might accept a certain level of cliche, but that’s not what they’re looking for.

They aren’t **satisfied** with cliche.

Readers who accept cliche and mediocrity are perpetually unsatisfied.

Which is why they read 10 books a week.

It does mean that there is a short term market value for cliche.

But, AI will always do cliche better than you.

And **you** are much more likely than AI to generate a joyful surprise.

---

which is precisely what readers of genre fiction are hoping for. 

the joyful surprise, in a narrative sequence where shit happens, as opposed to where shit doesn’t happen.

which is why they choose to read genre fiction.

because it’s supposed to be a guaranteed that shit’s going to happen.

as opposed to literature, where there’s always a danger that nothing happens.

---

So **you** are very good at figuring out the thing that’s **unlikely** to happen next.

And AI is very good at figuring out what’s likely to happen. 

But, the most likely thing will never be the most surprising thing.

The most likely thing will be the cliche.

And by definition, a cliche can never be surprising.

The most surprising thing will be arbitrary.

So, the key concept here is the arbitrary, or arbitrariness.

What does it mean for something to be arbitrary? 

The definition I got from Google isn’t very satisfying.

> Arbitrariness is the quality of being based on random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system.
> 

All true, but the arbitrary and arbitrariness are more than that, for the reader and writer.

So let’s unpack it.

First of all, the arbitrary is always a decision.

The arbitrary is decisive because it necessarily comes first.

The arbitrary is prior to reason and process. 

It is unconnected from necessity, or reason. 

The arbitrary has a lack of natural connection to whatever came before it. 

This is the definition of arbitrariness.

There is no rhyme or reason for why something arbitrary happens. 

Because then it wouldn’t be arbitrary.

The arbitrary is equally disconnected from justice, or fairness. 

I am not trying to be obscure here, it’s just that a satisfactory definition of magic is elusive.

---

All beginnings are arbitrary.

And I’m not only referring to the beginning of a narrative, which is also by definition arbitrary.

There are many beginnings, or openings within narratives, and each one is arbitrary.

Or else it wouldn’t be a beginning, it would be procedural, following on from an arbitrary beginning.

Etymology is the study of the origin of words, and how their meanings change. 

The creation of new words is always arbitrary.

Ferdinand de Saussure was a Swiss linguist, working in the early 20th century.

He said that the relationship between the "signifier" and the "signified" is arbitrary.

In other words, the relationship between a sound or symbol, and the thing it is supposed to signify or represent, is arbitrary.

The word “tree” has absolutely no intrinsic relationship to a tree.

They could have chosen the word rock for a tree, but maybe rock was already taken, I don’t know.

---

All beginnings are arbitrary.

And all arbitrary decisions are new beginnings.

A narrative work of fiction requires arbitrary decisions almost continuously. 

Each arbitrary decision creates a new fork in the universe.

The storyteller’s question is always the same: what happens next.

And **you** are much more likely than an AI to answer that question with a joyful surprise.

---

There is a strong relation between character, agency, and the arbitrary.

By character, I am not referring to a named person in your book.

I am referring to the radical definition of this term.

By character I mean to address the qualities or attributes that mark a person as someone **with character**.

Here’s a way to think about it. 

Generally, people behave in predictable ways. 

And for the creation of a character, it’s always important to set up routines. 

The person is predictable, and a routine becomes expected.

So, when the person breaks the routine with an arbitrary action, surprise is generated.

This is the definition of character. A person who will sometimes behave in surprising ways.

My uncle was a character. He did weird things sometimes. 

On the other hand, my next door neighbor is pretty bland. She’s always exactly the same.

My uncle possessed character, my neighbor does not.

A character who can surprise you, is said to possess agency.

A character who does not generate surprise, has no agency.

Characters without agency are uninteresting. They are moved around by the agency of others, or by arbitrary events that happen outside of their control.

Raymond Chandler wrote that "When in doubt, have a man come through the door with a gun in his hand.”

This might not sound arbitrary, but the decision to have the man come through the door with a gun in his hand is arbitrary. It’s a shortcut to creating a new beginning.

Don’t get me wrong, you don’t need new beginnings every time the question “what happens next” is posed. 

Sometimes what happens next is a logical step from the thing that happened before.

But once in a while you need an arbitrary decision, either in the narrative events more generally, or in your character’s actions.

Usually an arbitrary decision will kick off a whole sequence of reasonable effects.

Until the next arbitrary decision starts the cycle all over again.

Arbitrariness is very annoying to systems of structure, order, uniformity, and adherence to a set of established rules or standards.

Or in other words, the enemy of the arbitrary is the programmatic.

And computers are the definition of programmatic.

When a person opens a mystery novel they aren’t hoping to enter a world of standardization. 

They’re not looking for a disciplinary experience, or a rigid set of programmatic codes.

They’re hoping to be surprised. 

Of course, they’re not looking for a purely arbitrary experience. 

They didn’t purchase a mystery novel hoping to get abstract poetry.

The combination of recognizable repetition punctuated by surprise, creates a sanctuary of narrative. 

A good narrative is fun, generates a feeling of freedom and opens the reader into an entire world of possibility. 

A good narrative creates joyful surprise in the mind of the reader.

This is something only achievable with a lot of arbitrariness.

Ai will never write a great book.

Because a great book requires the kind of arbitrary decision making that you are very good at, but computers are terrible at.

So I have a suggestion for you.

Don’t try and write a book that AI will be good at writing, because AI will be better at it than you.

Write the book that you are good at writing, one that delights and surprises your readers.
