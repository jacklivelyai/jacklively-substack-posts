The Public Enemy 01
### Intro

After the October 7th attacks, I was very disoriented by the public reaction around me.

I live in London, in the UK, and this is my area of operations. Plus, my milieu (if you will) is academic and artistic oriented people. So I‚Äôll bear that in mind when discussing my own experiences.

It‚Äôs been a little over a year now, and I‚Äôm still processing the situation, trying to understand.

What‚Äôs most confusing is the attitudes and reactions of the people who I had considered to be my **public**.

This rumination will therefore explore what that means, a public.

What I think of as a bizarre delirium seems to have caught hold of people more generally, here and in the USA.

I don‚Äôt really have too much insight into the ambient situation of other publics in Continental Europe, but I see anecdotally that this seems to be the case there as well, perhaps even more so depending upon the country. 

I‚Äôll start with the October 7th events. 

I came across a description of the October 7th attack by a certain Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch. I don‚Äôt know anything about the Rabbi, but his description is almost perfectly aligned with my own understanding of the events.

 I‚Äôll quote him here:

> We assumed that this kind of medieval bloodlust was no longer possible in our era ‚Äî and we lack the verbal skills to capture our emotions. It was a spasm of savagery, a pack of feral wolves ripping their prey, blood dripping from their teeth. They were proud of what they did. They filmed themselves. And the revelry continued in Gaza, where the hostages were presented to an ecstatic population as the spoils of war. Sweets were handed out. And the ghoulish euphoria spread to the West. Social media pulsated exultantly. Soon streets and campuses erupted in jubilation, blaming the victims for their own victimhood.
> 

I‚Äôm a professional writer and capable of generating my own version of this, but Hirsch‚Äôs take on it is almost perfect.

Now, I understand that some people would use an entirely different linguistic framework when describing October 7th. 

What‚Äôs important to me here is to convey to those who do not understand it, that this is the way ***we*** see it. This, ***for us*, *for me***, captures the difference between us and them. 

And, it‚Äôs true that binary thinking is limited, there are always in-betweens. But sometimes it‚Äôs necessary to create binaries, because sometimes you need to clarify thinking.

Here‚Äôs the binary that is key to understand how I and others approach this topic. 

<aside>
üí°

There are acceptable behaviors in war, and there is the unacceptable.

Whenever I have seen or would see evidence of Israeli or American or British, or French soldiers or civilians conducting themselves badly, I have and will continue, to fully expect a thorough investigation and subsequent punishment. 

</aside>

And I‚Äôm not alone in that.

Just go to an Israeli news website. There are almost constant investigations of this nature by the military and the police.

In part this is defensive, since a sovereign state that is incapable of investigating potential abuses by its own armed forces exposes itself to the jurisdiction of bodies such as the International Criminal Court. In this sense it is super important that the Israelis investigate allegations of abuse by their armed forces, and citizens. 

In a war situation, levels of stress and anxiety are high. There‚Äôs no war without some soldier or other abusing their power. It always happens. 

And it requires systematic investigation, and eventually a transparent revelation of the outcome. 

What we saw on October 7th went way beyond what is even remotely acceptable in a high stress, war time situation. And the fact that this observation does not form the starting point of every discussion in every place that this current war is discussed, is also completely unacceptable to me.

### These People

Israel, for those who do not know, is a country in the middle east. To its west is the Mediterranean sea, to the north is Lebanon, while to the east are Jordan and Syria. The northern border is with Lebanon. The point here, is that Israel does not share a border with Sweden, Switzerland, or Holland.

Anyone who purports to care for the Palestinian people, will surely be curious about the Israeli, and Israeli supporting point of view. So, I‚Äôll give it to you in a nutshell.

The way that Hamas killed our friends and relatives on October 7th, reminds us of the Syrian Civil war and the behavior of ISIS. With shades of the Hutu‚Äôs massacre of the Tutsis in Rwanda.

Let‚Äôs illustrate this with an example.

One particularly gruesome event of the Syrian Civil War took place in 2013.

A rebel officer affiliated with the Al Nusra front - one of the Salafist sunni groups - filmed himself cutting into the chest of a dead Syrian soldier and appearing to bite into one of the organs, reportedly the heart or lung. 

Unfortunately, events like this were not isolated. Do an internet search and you‚Äôll find dozens, maybe hundreds. 

In 2014 ISIS massacred between 5 to 10,000 Yazidi men and old women.

Approximately 7,000 women and girls were taken into sexual slavery, subjected to rape and forced marriage.

Boys were taken as child soldiers and brainwashed into ISIS ideology.

In 2018 the Syrian government forces used chemical weapons on the village of Douma.

A video surfaced in 2022 showing members of Syrian security forces executing dozens of blindfolded men, who were then thrown into a pit and set on fire.

None of these were isolated incidents. It seems to be the way that these people wage war.

Who are these people?

Quite simply, these people live on the borders of Israel. They are to the north, to the east, to the south, and perhaps within.

### War And Pogrom Are Not The Same Thing

There‚Äôs another binary to keep in mind. The individual and the group. 

Different organized groups permit different kinds of behavior. Even if individually people are all super nice when you actually meet them.

Hirsch‚Äôs description captures the difference, in my mind, between a more or less acceptable pursuit of war, and a totally unacceptable murderous rampage - which was celebrated by large organized groups of people. 

War and pogrom are not the same thing. 

Let‚Äôs just take the United States military as an example for a moment. 

Over the course of 100 years or so, there have been examples of unacceptably murderous behavior, like killings in cold blood. 

The My Lai Massacre in Vietnam, where between 300 and 500 civilians were killed.

The No Gun Ri Massacre in Korea, between 200 and 500 civilians were killed.

US massacres in Vietnam and Korea were clearly unacceptable. I‚Äôm not aware of any case of an academic, or cultural figure, political leader in the west, or celebrity attempting to justify the massacres of My Lai or No Gun Ri. 

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, and you could correct me.

But the October 7th massacre against Israeli civilians is endlessly justified, and quite often openly celebrated. And not only by Palestinians, or super religious jihadists. It‚Äôs been openly celebrated by American and British christians and secular atheists.

This is insane to me.

This rumination tries to get to grips with how such a ‚Äúghoulish euphoria‚Äù has spread to the public sphere of London, or New York, to people who have nothing at all to do with the Middle East and don‚Äôt experience living with the kinds of borders that I mentioned earlier.

In short, I believe that the phenomenon of support for Hamas and Hizbollah, among middle class Christian, Atheist, or even Jewish secular liberals in the so called ‚Äúwest‚Äù, symptomizes an underlying loss of connection to the principles by which our lucky societies came to exist in the first place.

Because as I will demonstrate, to develop a liberal democratic secular state, required very strong foundational principles.

Today, in the place of foundational principles, a political order here is tottering on a flimsy base of Nihilism.

This is a conclusion that makes sense to me, however sad it is, because Nihilism is a failure to establish foundational principles that anyone would consider worth defending.

And so, in conditions of Nihilism, you end up with parts of the public who do not have a connection to any real value system, outside of remote and universal abstractions, and end up attracting to idiotic or even dangerous ideas, fashionable statements, and trendy buzzwords, like leftover food scraps in the sink spinning towards the drain.

### Occupation and its Discontents

The often quoted justification for Hamas‚Äôs October 7th attack is the Israeli Palestinian conflict more generally, and the settlements and Israeli control of territory in the West Bank more specifically. Then there‚Äôs the so called siege of Gaza.

I‚Äôm not going to go into this exhaustively, but it‚Äôs important to set up some touch points here, mapping the territory if you will. 

So, first of all, and obviously, most people in London, New York, or Seattle who voice an opinion on the middle east know nothing about any of these issues. They‚Äôre complete ignoramuses who‚Äôs expression of opinion are simply a matter of fashion. 

But‚Ä¶

Prior to October 7th, every single Israeli who I know was against what is referred to as the occupation in the West Bank.

Obviously, I don‚Äôt know every Israeli. It‚Äôs just an indication of my circle of friends and my family. 

Basically, leftist in Israeli terms. Sometimes, extreme leftists.

Prior to October 7th, these are people who would have agreed with a denunciation of Israeli government policy regarding the Palestinians. In fact, people who actively demonstrated and campaigned against the Israeli policy.

After October 7th the picture has become more complicated. By and large, none of my Israeli friends or relatives now has the slightest clue how they‚Äôd live side by side with Palestinians in the future. 

I would argue that this question has always been THE salient question and that we‚Äôve all been living in a denial of cultural difference.

---

### Culture Matters

But anyway‚Ä¶

Recent polls of Palestinians and Israelis tell a story.

Let‚Äôs begin before the October 7th Massacre. 

**A 2022 poll taken by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research finds that‚Ä¶**

- **Support for the two-state solution is 33% among the Palestinians and 34% among Israeli Jews.**

Which means that the majority on both sides aren‚Äôt into it. There is no majority on either side that supports a two state solution.

I want to reflect on this a moment. 

A two state solution requires a Palestinian commitment to having a state. If that‚Äôs not there, then there is no solution. This isn‚Äôt a fringe poll by the way, it‚Äôs the gold standard, conducted under the supervision of Dr. **Khalil Shikaki, a** Palestinian pollster who‚Äôs respected by all sides.

The vast majority of Palestinians don‚Äôt want a two state solution, they want a one state solution.

While Israelis, who have their own state already, don‚Äôt consider a Palestinian state to be important any longer.

I‚Äôm reading again from the findings of this 2022 poll‚Ä¶

- **Each side perceives itself as an exclusive victim (84% of Palestinians and 84% of Israeli Jews), while an overwhelming majority of Palestinians (90%) but only a smaller majority of Israeli Jews (63%) think this suffering grants them a moral right to do anything they deem as necessary for survival.**

So, 90% of Palestinians and 63% of Israeli Jews consider that there are no limits to what they can legitimately do to the other side. I think the Israeli 63% is also insane and worrying, but it‚Äôs about one third less than the Palestinians.

- **A vast majority among both groups (93%) see themselves as rightful owners of the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan river. While a third of Israeli Jews are willing to accept some ownership right of the Palestinians, only 7% of Palestinians are willing to accept such ideas about the Jews.**

Okay, interesting. A third of Israeli Jews willing to share the land with Palestinians, and less than ten percent of Palestinians prepared to do the same. Doesn‚Äôt look good, huh?

---

Now let‚Äôs go to the same polling outfit for a glance at opinions among the Palestinians after October 7th, 2023. 

That is to say, after the massacres.

- Among Palestinians polled, 94% think Israel has committed war crimes during the current war.
- 91% of Palestinians think Hamas **did not commit war crimes during the current war**.

This breaks down in a deeply concerning way.

- Among Palestinians who say that **they saw videos of the October 7th massacres**, of Hamas members and Gazan civilians killing Israeli civilians, 81% say that Hamas did not commit atrocities.

Basically, either that they don‚Äôt believe their own eyes, or they refuse to accept that what they have seen is an atrocity because it‚Äôs somehow justified and explained as something else, resistance, de-colonization, I don‚Äôt know.

This is insane. This is impossible to ignore and colors my opinions about the other stuff.

The only real alternative to Israeli military control of the West Bank is for the Israelis to exit completely and return over the green line to the recognized borders of the state of Israel.

Obviously the problem is that the Palestinians don‚Äôt recognize those borders.

And given the polling data above as an indication, they‚Äôd have no problem supporting more massacres across the border.

None of which means that I am a supporter of West Bank settlements, I‚Äôm not. 

I think the occupation of the west bank corrupts Israelis. Controlling Palestinian populations screws up the soldiers sent to enforce it. Suppression and repression of other people is a terrible thing and a moral weight. 

> As Golda Meir said: "When peace comes, we will perhaps in time be able to forgive the Arabs for killing our sons, but it will be harder for us to forgive them for having forced us to kill their sons. Peace will come when the Arabs will love their children more than they hate us.‚Äù
> 

The last thing I‚Äôll say about this is the following:

There are two fundamental ways that you can understand a map of Israel.

- One, is within the sovereign borders of Israel. That is to say, without including the West Bank.
- The second way is to say the West Bank must be included within Israel since it is the de facto Sovereign.

In light of what I‚Äôve discussed just now regarding Palestinian opinions about the possibility of a Palestinian state, I just don‚Äôt see how the Israelis can easily leave the West Bank. 

Even if you want to, how would you do it?

You only need to look at a map of this territory to see that it‚Äôs a suicidal move. Yes, I believe that there needs to be a solution to endless Palestinian self destruction, but I don‚Äôt at all see why the Israelis need to do **all** the heavy lifting.

Hello, but there‚Äôs this thing called the international system, with ex-colonial powers who do a lot of scolding, but not so much pragmatic solution finding.  

Regarding Gaza. Israel withdrew unilaterally in 2005. 

After Hamas took power there, the Egyptian and Israeli siege was real - not a war crime by the way. You can lay siege to an enemy territory to prevent it from getting weapons to attack you with. I‚Äôm not sure what the Egyptian excuse was. 

In any case, it‚Äôs obvious now that the siege wasn‚Äôt rigorous enough.

The Egyptians have a border with Gaza and have much to answer for. 

All of this is insufficient as a discussion of a fascinating and complex situation.

But it‚Äôll have to do.

Now on to my reflections on the blowback here in the west.

Why are people walking around in serious delirium?

Why are people such demented fucking zombies these days?

### The Public

You are a member of a public, as am I. 

This must be true regardless of where you live.

No man is an Island, goes the saying.

Many people might agree with the idea that they are a member of THE public, meaning I suppose, those who are not in government. 

In this framing, there is the government and there is the public. 

Some might even say that the public are those who frequent public spaces.

And in this sense the meaning is slightly different.

As public spaces are not private spaces. 

My kids go to public schools, not private schools. 

I‚Äôm a member of a private club, not open to ‚Äúmembers of the public‚Äù.

Yet, of course, this breaks down because after school the kids all play in the same public park, regardless of which school they go to.

But once I leave the house, I‚Äôm **in public**.

---

So, there are multiple publics, within THE public.

Any artist or musician who gains traction with their work can speak of their public.

---

Barbra Streisand said, *"I think of my audience as my friends. I don't think of them as a public."*

Edith Piaf said, ‚Äú*My public understands me in a way that transcends language."*

---

What about Public Enemies?

Well, in the early to mid 20th century, American law enforcement and media labeled some wanted criminals as **Public Enemies**. 

The conceit here was that there existed a single homogenous public within the United States of America for whom there could be a common enemy.

A Public Enemy. 

At the height of prohibition America, charismatic criminals, like Dillinger, Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly, or Bonny and Clyde, went all in on murder and robbery.

As if they thought they could get away with it.

Organized crime, Mafias, posed a challenge to the state‚Äôs monopoly on violence.

So, the organs of public order regarded that as an intolerable threat, and the nascent FBI under J Edgar Hoover used this terminology as a justification for liquidating the threat.

In doing so, they consolidated their own power, as state institutions.

So those were Public Enemies. the Non-State actors who posed a challenge to the public.

From the 1960s onward the terminology changed.

Now, the term **public enemy** has given way to ‚Äúsuspects‚Äù, or, ‚Äúmost wanted‚Äù, or ‚Äúpersons of interest‚Äù.

But does that mean there are no more public enemies?

---

### Question:

What would have happened if the armed non-state actors were left alone and just did their thing?

The USA would probably look even more like Lebanon or Mexico than it does today.

---

The phrase "public enemy" was meant to emphasize that these enemies posed a threat to order, security and public safety. 

A public enemy was deemed particularly dangerous because their actions were seen as destabilizing to the political order.

In this sense, addressing a threat to the common political order as a Public Enemy, at the same time marked this defensible public as a political body. 

The Public that is defended, is defined as such.

### October 7

These reflections on the question of a public and its potential enemies came to me, literally walking down the street.

This was shortly after October 7th, 2023. 

After the Hamas attack on Israel.

I live in London now, and as I said before, I was surprised at the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù reaction. 

On my part it wasn‚Äôt so complicated. I have cousins who live in kibbutz Kfar Azza, who spent 24 hours stuck in a safe room. 

That‚Äôs what they were doing on October 7th.

The dad held the door to the safe room closed while a bunch of murderous rapist scumbags, totally stoned on Captagon and Jihad, tried to get inside and do terrible things to him and his two teenage daughters and 90 year old mother. 

Like in some horror story, or a fairy tale about evil.

Luckily in this case they did not succeed.

But anyway, back in London.

After October 7th my relationship with non jewish, non Israeli friends and acquaintances got weird. 

This is true for my jewish, Israeli friends as well. Everyone deals with it differently.

So, here‚Äôs the issue.

It‚Äôs one thing to deal with committed ideologues who understand what they‚Äôre doing or saying.

Who come to it with some knowledge or comprehensible point of view.

Quite another to come to terms with regular people who have no real reason to take one or another position on something so intense, but do so out of fashion, or because of a popularity contest.

Talking to British of American friends and acquaintances about October 7th was so strange because people seemed confused.

They seemed to be unsure of what their own disposition should be, in relation to the October 7th massacre.

Which was so highly disturbing. 

Given the nature of the events themselves.

How could they be unsure?

What was there to be confused about?

At this point we should remind ourselves of what actually happened that day.

### The Deed Itself

Let‚Äôs recap a few objective facts about the 7th of October. 

- Hamas commandos invaded the Sovereign state of Israel and murdered 1400 people, including 859 civilians.
- After the initial wave of elite Nukhbah commandos, a second and third wave of Hamas and Gazan civilians swept in and continued murdering. Many of these were cold blooded murders and included atrocities like rape, torture, and decapitations.
- They did so in a state of ecstasy, captured for the record by hundreds of body cams and live streamed to the internet. The joyfulness with which they slaughtered the living, desecrated, and defiled the dead and wounded are evident for all to see.
- Through it all you can hear the same Arabic phrase, the most common words in all of the video evidence: *Allahu Akbar*. God Is Great.
- 240 Israelis were captured and brought back as hostages. The hostages included 33 children and babies, plus a non-trivial amount of elderly people.
- On top of the live captives, the Gazans stole approximately 100 corpses of civilians and soldiers whom they had killed and brought the bodies back into Gaza.

These are not controversial assertions. Everyone knows this.

### Back to London

So back to London. 

By October 8th pro-Hamas protests had exploded around the world.

London, New York, Berlin, Paris, as well as where you‚Äôd expect, like Istanbul and Iran.

And my friends were confused.

Somehow, even though what I‚Äôve just recounted was known, published, available for all to see on live streamed video, people around me, friends, acquaintances, were confused. 

Which to me, was really confusing.

Was it not obvious?

No, I guess not.

The question that has plagued me ever since goes something like this:

Who are these people, British or American, whom I assumed shared some common understanding with?

If they‚Äôre all so unsure about the ethics or morality of the October 7th attack, how do they understand themselves within the place we collectively live? 

Am I in the same ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù as they are?

This two part rumination is an attempt to address those questions.

---

Okay, that‚Äôs the end of Part One. 

Part Two of this exploration will dive into the question of how pluralist societies came to be developed. 

We‚Äôll return to the middle east to understand why such social bodies have not been successful at forming Arab pluralist publics.

I hope that you‚Äôve found this interesting.

Stay tuned for Part Two.

See you next time.
